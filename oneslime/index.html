</tr>
<tr><td colspan="2" align="center">
It's a volleyball game. There are two players - if you are playing a one 
player game, then you are the player on the left. Win points by 
making the ball land on your opponent's side of the court. The first 
player to six points wins! You can touch the ball as many times as you 
like, and you can win a point even if you don't serve. 
You can play against a friend, or challenge the five computer
opponents in one player mode.
